To make a directory work as a github repository the next command
must be used on the directory that you want to affect:
git init

To view the status of the files in the repository, this is the
command:
git status

To stage the unstaged files or directories on the github directory
this is the command used:
git add nameOfTheFileOrDirectory

To configurate the user of the directory, the next command is
needed:
git config --global user.email "your@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

To save a snapshot of your repository you use the following
command:
git commit -m "Message of the snapshot"

To view the information commits use the command:
git log

To undo the unsaved changes made to a file use the next command:
git checkout -- nameOfTheFileOrDirectory

To view the differences in a file between the saved version and
the unsaved version use this command:
git diff nameOfTheFileOrDirectory

If we want to ignore a directory when making git add, or
git commit, we need to create a file named .gitignore where we
will write the names of the directories that the git
commands need to ignore.
